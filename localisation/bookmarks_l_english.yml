 HEART_OF_DARKNESS_NAME:0 "The Heart of Darkness"
 HEART_OF_DARKNESS_DESC:0 "The continent that saw the cradle of slavery shall also be its grave. No longer will the dark continent be dragged into another century of pain and bloodshed."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Cross and the Dragon"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "The aftermath of La Grande Guerre affected the Far East in ways different to the West. While the Russian Empire coils inward around Sankt Petrograd and splinters all across Siberia, the Empire of China burns like a reinvigorated candle. La Grande Guerre re-sparked the glory of the Orient, and soon the world will have to answer in-consequence."
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Pheonix and the Deluge"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The eventuality of the Great Continental War was one of certainty, but the bloodshed and toll and the sway of the war's legacy on global events was one that nobody could predict. As the world plummets into darkness, the ancestral rage of Eurasia seeks to tear it apart once more. Will the world be scorched by the Bavarian Pheonix? Or drowned in the French deluge?"
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Birthplace of the Revolution, the ire of the old order... and the punching bag of Europe. For the past hundred years, Britain has sat on the sidelines, observing but never taking part, never having a chance to shine following the devastating defeat of 1830.\n\nBritain must take an active role and spread the revolution beyond her borders. There will be no Peace for Our Time until the world's oceans are painted red."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great Continental War saw the true might and greatness of France after a series of defeats in the century prior. A generation of the country's finest either earned their mettle as heroes or died as fierce martyrs of France. A generation of warriors that has grown increasingly disatisfied with the weakness of the French politians.\n\nThe victors of La Grande Guerre demand retribution, and glory and strong leadership, and they will flood the remains of Europe until their dreams are met."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "There was once a time when Bavaria was the envy of Europe. Where Munchen rivaled Vienna in grandeur and the Kreigswehr went toe-to-toe against the likes of France, Poland and China. La Grande Guerre stripped every ambition we had from under our feet, but just like a pheonix, we were reborn! Economic stability while the rest of the world starves, military competency while the great powers suffer mutinies, and a soldier king who will lead us to victory!"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While victorious, the Italian Union of Crowns stood nothing to gain from La Grande Guerre./n/nWith a collapsing colonial empire and families forced to sleep on the streets, Italy understands that the future lies not in warfare but in diplomacy. And the experiences of Pope Pius XII in the Adriatic Wars have taught him the same."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Tokugawa Bakufu faces total collapse as the Shoni Clan to the south proves unrelenting, with only a thin strip of European settlements blockading their hell-march toward Edo. The Shoni have been a thorn on our side for a century and we must put down these rabble-rousing usurpers if we wish to maintain the rump state we have left."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Emperor Alexander was merely a child when the reality of war forced him to pick up arms and fight, not only for his own life, but for that of his followers, his people and his only surviving family within the borders of Russia, his niece Anastaja. Having become a war hero and a living legend, the aging emperor has had to rely solely on his cult of personality to hold the beleaguered empire together against the same factionalism and greed that destroyed Russia during the Greater Time of Troubles... A reputation that is slowly wearing thin as the emperor's reforms march past the heads of old guard in power."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following slavery's total decline in 1830, the United States sought to create an indestructable, progressive and united nation. Instead, America was met with a frustrated and predominantly Catholic south demanding equal representation, the failure of full racial integration amongst a beaten and disenfranchised black peoples, ineffective poverty relief and public works programs, and the rise of Third-Positionism amongst the dissident population."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by La Grande Guerre, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "The sacrifices of La Grande Guerre will not be forgotten, neither the pain of the trenches nor the struggle against Lithuanian and German domination. \n\nBut with the Lithuanian beast and the German menace carved down to size, those sacrifices and jarring memories become no more than excuses for decadence among the forgettful and arrogant. In the west, the Bavarian emperor Rupprecht makes no secret of his desire for "Neuedeutschland", and in the East, Lithuania is rebuilding in power. And Poland will once again be the first to face the fire."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered La Grande Guerre as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the blood and mud of Sedan, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled with internal divisions between the French-speaking majority and the Norwegians of Acadia and Lac-Taranto, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australianos earned their place in the history books of La Grande Guerre in blood. The sacrifices made in the disasterous Iberian campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nTierra Austral now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her humiliated colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another losing conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Rome has always been.\n\nOlder than the birth of Our Saviour, Rome has proven time and time again capable and adaptive against the worst tragedies to befall the Empire. Having been present upon the shores of Carthage where the salting took place and at the Conference of Berlin where Africa was divided, Rome has truly earned the moniker, "the Pheonix of the Levant", an unkillible and immortal power. Our victory in the Great Continental War was marginal and our influence begins to decline once again, it is apparent that we must strive for greatness once again!"
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in La Grande Guerre, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Phnom Penh and on the Indochinese front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of La Grande Guerre, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 PAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Rajput nation is scarred by tragedies spanning centuries before the Great Continental War. Being the only Manichean nation on the planet, and having only recently opened up its borders to the rest of the world, the great powers never shy a day from reminding the Rajput state of their perpetual isolation, and the Rajput people know this.\n\nStained by a history of genocide, technological stagnation and humilitations by foreign powers, the Rajput nation must overcome the darkest sides of their past and rise as a land, not just of kings, but of brothers."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "The American Powderkeg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last century, the world the world witnessed horrific and bloody wars break out of the American continent, signalling the end of innocence in paradise. The previous decades have been marked by bitter peace and tense armistice, but as the entire globe reaches a boiling point, old emnities resurface from the dead and revanche blows her vile horn once more."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from La Grande Guerre, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "La Grande Guerre still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by La Grande Guerre, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered La Grande Guerre as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Grande Guerre in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "When the Grande Guerre began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of La Grande Guerre chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in La Grande Guerre, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of La Grande Guerre, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in La Grande Guerre.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During La Grande Guerre, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after La Grande Guerre. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of La Grande Guerre, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 ROM_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the losing side of La Grande Guerre, and as a result lost much land and people. To guard against further attempts by ambitious vermin to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."

 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "La Grande Guerre brought us victory and prestige and land and influence. As the power of the Orthodox Church increases, so does our own.\n\nGod save the Emperor and Glory to the Eternal Dragon Throne!"
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "We are Shigkokuans, We are Kyushuans, We are Catholics, We are Warriors. We are free to make our own destiny, and we will not be prisoners to the monster in Kyoto!"
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."

 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:1 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side, but there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
 MEXICO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico faced two decades of civil wars after the overthrow of the tyrant Porfirio Díaz. Centralizers fought regionalists, peasants and socialists rallied against hacienda landlords, and battles over the role of state versus religion came out of the annals of the Enlightenment to terrorize Mexico.\n\nThe secularist government insists that it won these battles, but it is seated on a throne of debris. After Mexico is rebuilt, perhaps a different victor will have emerged."
 MEXICO_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The government of Lázaro Cárdenas has shown itself to be a bigger force for positive social change than that of his predecessor President Plutarco Calles, who has now been exiled to America. With the economic situation stabilized and the foreign oil firms brought under the custodianship of the state, the Mexican government can begin to look outwards. America faces enemies on many fronts and will likely forgive the nationalization of Standard Oil, but those enemies may be even more lucrative to befriend..."
 NETHERLANDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dutch government eyes the mounting global tensions with concern. Between an ailing economy, a powerful pacifist movement, and a firm belief in neutrality to the point of driving potential allies away, they are unable to properly prepare their defenses.\n\nAt the same time, the importance of the Netherlands as a gateway of trade into the continent means that both the British and the Germans desire Dutch 'cooperation' to thwart the other, and may take rejection as a reason for hostility. Perhaps withdrawal to the colonies is the only possible means to resist such an invasion..."
 NETHERLANDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War between Germany and the other European major powers seems inevitable, and though the Netherlands has put its faith once again in its neutrality, its leaders are contemplating making secret staff plans with their southern neighbors in preparation for possible hostilities.\n\nThe army has been mobilized, and work on the Dutch defensive lines is increasing in pace in an attempt to get the country as ready as possible to defend against any infringement of its sovereignty. Should this fail, there are always the colonies..."
 SPAIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Within the first four decades of the twentieth century, the declining Spanish Empire has already had to deal with crushing military defeats, the loss of colonial holdings, humiliating peace treaties and concessions to France and her allies, strikes, a military coup attempt, and a major revolutionary uprising. Though it has survived these challenges, Spanish society continues to be marred by political polarization and violence between anarchists, republicans, and falangists."
 SPAIN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The civil war that has devastated the country for the past three years has finally concluded. Under the guidance of Franco, the victors must now see to Spain's recovery, the elimination of remaining pockets of resistance, and the mending of the divides created by the war.\n\nTime is not unlimited, however, as the world at large continues its inexorable march towards what will undoubtedly be a far larger and still more bloody war. If Spain is to stand its ground, let alone reap the fruits of opportunity presented by this coming conflict, it must ready its industry and its military without delay."
 PORTUGAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Pedro IV's rise to power in 1826, Portugal has been gradually distancing herself from the unstable period of the old Empire. The unification of all colonial and home territories under a single Union of Kingdoms lead to greater unity amongst the subjects of the Empire, while fiscal autonomy and political independence from the major powers led to the creation of the Estado Novo Doctrine, laying the foundations for the development of the Portuguese industry and the modernization of the army."
 PORTUGAL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The conservative government of Salazar allowed Portugal to remain neutral during the Spanish Civil War while actively supporting the Nationalists, thus ensuring the defeat of the Communists and the Anarchists. \n\nNow that the Iberian Peninsula has finally found stability, it is time to look abroad for potential allies and consider the role that Portugal will play on the seemingly inevitable world conflict."
